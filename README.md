# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This project was created using Bootstrap to replicate a previous portfolio that had been made in HTML and CSS. This was done to practice using Bootstrap. 

I learnt to use Bootstrap and customise the stylings to suit my needs. I also learnt how to adjust the column sizes to fit the design and responsiveness intended. 

I used my Figma wireframe to build the structure and layout of the site, before using Bootstrap to identify and use appropriate components, such as the jumbotron, navbar and cards.
